            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
            including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for
            about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before
            Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
            tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
            permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
            most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
            Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
            (some of them masquerade balls). The first record of Mardi Gras
            being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi
            River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March
            2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part
            of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first
            celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. Shrove
            Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for
            that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the
            mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation.
            Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black,
            yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in
            grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and
            disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds,
            beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes'
            heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon;
            mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on
            foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, &c., in rich
            confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing,
            laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour
            broadcast as they wend their reckless way

          <div class="info">
            (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor
            of New Orleans, Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018.
            Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first woman to hold the post. Before
            becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans
            City Council from 2012â€“2018. Mayor of New Orleans Cantrell was
            inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the
            position in the city's history. Once in office, she established a
            new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a
            strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell
            also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council tasked with finding
            solutions to violent crime.[29] Starting with a push to rededicate
            hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has
            focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure,
            public transportation, public parks, and green spaces.[30] As part
            of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a
            lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and distributors
